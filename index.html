        <p class="description">Hate crimes appear to be less common in the southeastern U.S. region compared to other regions of the country. The hate crime offender rate (per 100,000) for each state was calculated by dividing the stateâ€™s total number of hate crime offenders from 2013 to 2023 by its population. According to the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/hate-crime">FBI</a>, offenders are the suspects involved in a hate crime. Multiple offenders may be involved in one incident, so the number of hate crimes in the data are not to be confused as the number of incidents where a hate crime occurred. </p>

        <p class="description">Washington, D.C. had the highest rate of hate crime offenders per 100,000 among U.S. states from 2013 to 2023. In a breakdown of the total hate crime offenders in the district, anti-gay bias was reported to have the most offenders. Among the top 10 bias motivations for hate crimes in Washington, D.C., four are related to race and ethnicity. Three are related to sexual orientation, one is related to gender identity, and two are related to religion. According to the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/hate-crime">FBI</a>, some incidents may be motivated by multiple biases.</p>
